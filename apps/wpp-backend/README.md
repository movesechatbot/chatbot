# Whatsapp Clone Web Application: Backend
---

Welcome to the WhatsApp Clone Web Application Backend repository! This repository contains the backend code for building a feature-rich messaging platform similar to WhatsApp. This project aims to replicate the functionality of WhatsApp, offering real-time messaging, video calls, file sharing, group chats, and various other features. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.

## Features

- Authentication: Implement secure login and registration processes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Real-time messaging: Enable real-time communication between users using Socket.IO.
- Chats: Utilized NoSQL (as message formats can vary, and it is scalable for realtime applications where number of users can be large) for storing conversation between user and groups.
- Live video stream for calls: Enjoy face-to-face communication with the integration of video calls, complete with ringing components and sounds using sockets and simple-peers.
- Typing/Online Status: Used Socket Server for emitting and receiving synchronous status updates.
- Logging: Utilize Winston and Logger for logging to monitor and troubleshoot application behavior.
- Validation: Validate user input using the Validator library.
- Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully using HTTP error middleware.
- Advanced Search: Easily find contacts with email or username.

## Getting Started
To get started with Whatsapp Clone, follow the steps:

#### 1. Clone Frontend and Backend repository: 
Frontend:
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/MickyG03/Whatsapp-Clone-Frontend.git"
```
Backend:
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/MickyG03/Whatsapp-Clone-Backend.git"
```
#### 2. Node JS and NPM installation: 
[Node Js]: Make sure you have Node JS and NPM package manager installed on your system.

#### 3. Install Yarn: 
While both NPM and Yarn are viable options, I lean towards Yarn due to its parallel installation feature, which ultimately saves time.
```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

#### 4. Install Packages:
```sh
cd "Whatsapp-Clone-Backend"
yarn install
```

#### 5. Setup MongoDB:
- Create account on [MongoDB-Atlas].
- Create a cluster and get the connection sring
- To connect and verify schemas on desktop, download [MongoDB-Compass] on your system and use connection string to connect to the cloud database of Atlas .

#### 6. Create .env file:
Create .env file in the frontend folder and add these fields:
```sh
PORT = {integer for your port}
NODE_ENV = development (Can be changed to production when you want to deploy)
DATABASE_URL= databse conenection url from step 5.
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = {generate an access token for JWT}
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = {generate a refresh token for JWT}
DEFAULT_PICTURE={source for default image for user}
DEFAULT_STATUS={Example: Hey there! I am using Whatsapp}
DEFAULT_GROUP_PICTURE={source for default image for group chats}
CLIENT_ENDPOINT= API endpoint for frontend {example: http://frontend-url:frontend-port}
```

#### 7. Start the app:
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn dev` :
Runs the app in the development mode. The nodemon enables server to reload when you make changes.\
You also Logger/Winston logs in the console.\

- `yarn start` :
Simply launches the node server. Server mayno reload when changes are saved and hence should be used for deployment purpose only.

#### 8. Install and Run Postman :
Download and run [Postman], to try routes pick one from "routes folder" or here are few api requests to test:

```
1. Register
Post http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register
Body: {
    "email":"",
    "picture":"",
    "status":"",
    "password":""
}

2. Login
Post http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login
Body: {
    "email":"",
    "password":""
}

3. Find Users
Get http://localhost:8000/api/v1/user?search={username}
Authorization -> Token : {use token from login}

4. Get Message
Get http://localhost:8000/api/v1/message/{conversation ID} 
Authorization -> Token : {use token from login}

5. Send Message
Post http://localhost:8000/api/v1/message
Authorization -> Token: {use token from login}
Body: {
    "convo_id":"",
    "message":""
}

and more in JS files of "Routes" directory.
```

#### 9. Setup and Run the Whatsapp Web Frontend:
See the "Getting started" section of [Whatsapp-Frontend] and get it up and running. Login to try the app.

## Tech
For this project I have used following libraries:

- [Node JS] - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. 
- [Yarn] - A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool. It's used for managing project dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments, and improving performance during the installation process.
- [React JS] -  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Socket IO] - A JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables bidirectional communication between web clients and servers, allowing for real-time updates and messaging in applications.
- [NodeMon] - A utility that monitors for changes in files and automatically restarts the Node.js application.
- [Mongoose] - An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- [JavaScript] - A programming language that enables dynamic content and interactivity on web pages.
- [Express] - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- [Winston] - A versatile logging library for Node.js, providing a simple and powerful way to log information in various formats.
- [JSON Webtoken] - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Used for secure authentication and authorization.
- [Bcrypt] - A library for hashing passwords and verifying password hashes. Commonly used for securing user authentication in web applications.
- [Postman] - A popular collaboration platform for API development that simplifies the process of testing, documenting, and sharing APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests, inspecting responses, and automating API testing workflows.
